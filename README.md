## Machine Learning

Notes from this class on Udemy. [here](https://www.udemy.com/machine-learning-with-javascript/learn/v4/overview)

### Steps for machine learning

If something changes then something else might change.

* Identify data that is relevant to the problem
* Assemble a set of data related to the problem you're trying to solve
* Decide on the type of output you are predicting
* Based on the type of output, pick an algorithm that will determine a correlation between your 'features' and 'labels'
* Use model generated by algorithm to make a prediction

Features are categories of data points that affect the value of a 'label'

#### Identifying Data Needed (Identifying Data)

Look at the problem you're trying to solve and decide what type of data you need.

#### Getting data (Assembling Data)

You may need to search multiple sources for data. Often data doesn't come in cleaned up packages so you will need to create the data on your own.

#### Type of Data We Might Try to Predict (Type of Output)

* `Classification` - The value of our labels belong to a discrete set.
  * Based on how many hours a student studied for an exam, did they PASS or FAIL (PASS or FAIL)
  * Based on the content of this email, is it SPAM or NOT SPAM (SPAM or NOT SPAM)
  * Based on where a football player shoots from, are they likely to SCORE or NOT SCORE (SCORE or NOT SCORE)
* `Regression` - The value of our labels belong to a continuous set.
  * Based on the year, make, and model of a car, what is it's value? ($0 - $50k)
  * Based on an individual's daily calorie intake and minutes spent exercising, what is their weight? (80lb - 400lb)
  * Based on the height of this pine tree, what is it's age? (0 years - 500 years)


#### Picking an Algorithm

Select an algorithm that fits the data selection and desired output.

#### Use model to predict

Use your decided algorithm and dataset to try to make a prediction.


### Plinko

`/projects/plinko/` Given some data about where a ball is dropped from, can we predict what bucket it will end up in?

* Where are we dropping the ball
* Range of Ball Bounciness
* Range of Ball Size (how large the ball is)

This problem will have 3 features and one label.

* Features (Changing one of these)
  * Drop Position
  * Ball Bounciness
  * Ball Size
* Labels (Will probably change this)
  * Buckets a ball lands in

#### Approaches

Array of Objects Approach - can get confusing when parsing

```
  [
    { dropPosition: 300, bounciness: 0.4, ballSize: 16, bucket: 4 },
    { dropPosition: 300, bounciness: 0.4, ballSize: 16, bucket: 4 },
    { dropPosition: 300, bounciness: 0.4, ballSize: 16, bucket: 4 },
    { dropPosition: 300, bounciness: 0.4, ballSize: 16, bucket: 4 }
  ]
```

Array of Array Approach - Need to keep track of what index means what

```
  [
    [300, 0.4, 16, 4],
    [350, 0.4, 25, 5],
    [416, 0.4, 16, 4],
    [722, 0.4, 16, 7]
  ]

```

#### Type of Output

Since we are trying to determine which bucking the ball will fall into, this would be a `Classification` since there are a finite amount of buckets.

#### Algorithm Selection

`K-Nearest Neighbor (knn)` - "Birds of a feather flock together"

Which Bucket will a ball go into if dropped at 300px.

* Drop a ball a bunch of times around the board, record which bucket it goes into
* For each observation, subtract drop point from 300px, take absolute value (this determines how close it is to the 300px drop we are trying to guess)
* Sort the results from least to greatest
* Look at the 'k' top records. What is the most common bucket? (k is a number of records you are going to use to find the most common bucket)
* Whichever bucket came up most frequently is the one ours will probably go into



```
const numbers = [
  [10, 5],
  [17, 2],
  [34, 1],
  [60, -5]
];

const sorted = _.sortBy(numbers, row => row[1]);
const mapped = _.map(sorted, row => row[1]);

const mapped2 = _.chain(numbers)
  .sortBy(row => row[1])
  .map(row => row[1])
	.value();

```
